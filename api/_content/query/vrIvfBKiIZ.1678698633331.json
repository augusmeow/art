It's the next level up, if you like, from the beat. The beat is there, but to hear the sounds as being musical, we hear more than just a succession of beats all the same.\nThe next concept is bar. We might talk about the number of beats in the bar. The number of beats in the bar, that is another way of talking about metre. The bar, also known as a measure, is a notional unit which relates to one complete metrical cycle. In other words, one cycle of the metre.\nIn stave notation, a bar is shown by a vertical line that runs from the top line of the stave down to the bottom. So, here's a bar, and you'll remember that with stave notation,\nAll of these are part of the ways that we can theorise about musical rhythm. But, finally, there's one more we should think about -- grouping.\nGrouping lets us talk about the way we hear musical sounds as belonging together, somehow, as phrases."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"dots-and-ties"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Dots and Ties"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Dot: A dot always sitting to the right-hand side of the notehead changes the duration value of that note.
